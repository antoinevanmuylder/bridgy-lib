*** Install ~agda --bridges~
~agda --bridges~ is an extension of cubical agda which add parametricity primitives to cubical type theory, as discussed in Cavallo-Harper (CH): https://arxiv.org/pdf/2005.11290.pdf.
This CH type system is implemented in a fork of agda, in the bridges branch: https://github.com/antoinevanmuylder/agda/tree/bridges.
To install with stack:
#+begin_src shell
git checkout bridges #in root dir agda/
stack update
cp stack.yaml<version> stack.yaml # choose version of haskell compiler
stack install # builds and copies agda binary to ~/.local/bin/
# stack install --fast
#+end_src
*** Download the cubical library and register it in ~/.agda/libraries~
Clone the appropriate repo: https://github.com/agda/cubical.
Once this is done, add the following line to your ~/.agda/libraries~ config file:
#+begin_src shell
<...>/cubical/cubical.agda-lib
#+end_src
*** Warning
The latest version of the cubical library ("cubical") is currently not compatible with agda master.
A fix is to revert cubical to commit d29db7f5e6cfe5d. The command is:
#+begin_src shell
git checkout d29db7f5e6cfe5d # while in cubical/
#+end_src
