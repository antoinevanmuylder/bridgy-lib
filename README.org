*** In this repo
Internal parametricity experiments, coded in ~agda --bridges~.
The ~--bridges~ branch can be found here https://github.com/antoinevanmuylder/agda/tree/bridges. It implements the parametricity primitives of Cavallo-Harper (CH) from https://arxiv.org/pdf/2005.11290.pdf. See ~INSTALL.org~ for instructions.
*** Note
To get rid of the ~NoEquivWhenSplitting~ warnings generated by some files of the cubical library:
#+begin_src bash
M-x load-library RET agda2-mode RET
M-x customize-group RET agda2 RET
#+end_src
Then insert the following line in the ~Agda2 Program Args~ list:
#+begin_src bash
--warning=noNoEquivWhenSplitting
#+end_src
