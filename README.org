This repo contains internal parametricity experiments, coded in ~agda --bridges~. The ~--bridges~ branch can be found here https://github.com/antoinevanmuylder/agda/tree/bridges. It implements the parametricity primitives of Cavallo-Harper (CH) from https://arxiv.org/pdf/2005.11290.pdf. See ~INSTALL.org~ for instructions.
*** Quick tour of the files
Check out the ~src/~ directory.
- ~BridgePrims.agda~: contains CH primitives.
- ~BridgeExamples.agda~: basic bridge behaviour + commutation principles for ~Bridge, Path, Σ, ×~.
- ~ExtentExamples.agda~: commutation with Π.
- ~GelExamples.agda~: commutation with equivalences, and the universe ("relativity").
- ~NativeReflGraphRelator.agda~: native reflexive graphs and relators, needed to state parametricity.
- ~ParamNativeRelator.agda~: general parametricity theorem: ~param~.
- ~SimpleParam.agda~: proofs of simple Church encodings with ~param~.
- ~ChurchCircle.agda~: partial proof of the circle Church encoding with ~param~. On 07/03/2022 we lack computational rules for transporting at Bridge types to conclude.
- ~SystemF.agda~: shallow embedding of system F where each semantic term is parametric thanks to ~param~.
